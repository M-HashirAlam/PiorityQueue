Our project name is A DATA STRUCTURE MAINTAINING Priority QUEUE in which have have to implement Priority QUEUE
we are asked some main functions which are Insert, Delete, Min,Update, Union
Insert function takes parameter name and piorirty
Delete functon take name of the element to Delete
Min function doesnot take any argument when it is called it directly returns the element with lowest piorirty
Union function merges two queues into one queue



The project consist of two classes One is NODE and one is Priority QUEUE
The node class is for adding data in the queue and Priority QUEUE class consists of function elpained above




For making 2 queues  have make two object Q1 and Q2
if you called function with Q1 it will act upon in Queue 1
if you call function with Q2 it will act upon in Queue 2
you can call merge function with any object
